# CartPole-DQN

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent is trained to balance a pole on a moving cart by learning an optimal policy through reinforcement learning.

## Features
- Q-Learning with a neural network approximator.
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
- Replay memory for experience replay.
- Custom reward function for enhanced feedback.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CartPole-DQN.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd CartPole-DQN

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
